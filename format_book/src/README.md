# Welcome!
Welcome to the Documentation Book. This place will serve as a core of Zenit's developer documentation.

Unfortunately, there isn't much here right now. Content will arrive at some point!

## Fancy TODO list
 * Chapter: BF2 Data Formats
 * Chapter: Zenit's Developer Guide (stuff like basic organization)
 * Chapter: Using the Zenit MDK (very quick stuff over things like how spec.toml is meant to be laid out)
