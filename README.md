Zenit is a project attempting to create an open-source engine compatible with data files of PC version of *Star Wars Battlefront II (2005)*.

Unlike the impressive [Phoenix](https://github.com/LibSWBF2/SWBF2Phoenix) project, Zenit tries to stay more faithful to the original game's look and feel, while also being fully portable. This doesn't mean that it'll never allow any graphical fireworks, but its priority is to at the very least look like the original. Zenit and and all of its dependencies are also open-source, if that's your thing (even if it does lose on graphical goodies of Unity, which are used in Phoenix).

It's still super early in its life and you can't even start it yet. Work is underway to make it at least load to menu, though. lol

## Building
To build Zenit you need a nightly build of Rust (`rustup toolchain add nightly`).

**On Windows:**
 * you need Visual C++ for building Lua
 * you also need `cargo-binutils` and `llvm-tools-preview`:
   ```sh
   $ cargo install -f cargo-binutils
   $ rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
   ```

**On Linux:**
 * you need Clang for its linker
 * it may also be used as the compiler, but I'm not sure if Rust won't hook into GCC for that, lol

**On macOS:**
 * LLD doesn't work, so you need zld: `brew install michaeleisel/zld/zld`

I think that's all, you can also look at the automated workflows in the [.github/workflows](.github/workflows) directory. Note, that I actively work on Windows as of now, so Linux and *especially* macOS builds are completely untested.

## Internal project structure
The project is separated into multiple crates in the src directory:
 * **src/zenit_utils** - general utilities and shared code
 * **src/zenit_lua** - Lua 5.0.2 bindings and a custom architecture independent x86-32 chunk loader
 * **src/zenit_lvl** - loader of BF2's level files, not dependent on anything besides utilities and proc macros
 * **src/zenit_lvl_core** - simple core of the level file reader, without any game-specific definitoins
 * **src/zenit_proc** - engine-wide proc macros
 * **src/zenit** - the main engine and the core of Zenit's codebase

Stuff that's not currently there but may be added in the future:
 * **src/zenit_mdk** - mod development kit, aka. an executable for generating munge files 

## License stuff
No license attached here yet; I'll finally add it someday lol

This project also comes with Lua 5.0.2, see [`src/zenit_lua/lua/COPYRIGHT`] for details.

Also, of course, I am not affiliated with the late Pandemic Studios, Disney or any other legal entities or individuals that may have any rights to the original game. This is merely a fan project to a game I feel a lot of nostalgia for. I'm not trying to breach any copyright laws here.
