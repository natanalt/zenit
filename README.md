# Zenit Engine
Zenit is a project attempting to create an open-source engine, compatible with data files of PC edition of *Star Wars Battlefront II (2005)*.

It's still super early in its life and you can't even start it yet. Work is underway to make it at least load to menu, though. lol

## Runtime requirements
 * A legal copy of PC SWBF2.
   DVD retail copies also work (I personally use one), just make sure to install the game properly first, to unpack the data.
   If you don't own a copy, you could get it on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/6060/Star_Wars_Battlefront_2_Classic_2005/)
 * Vulkan capable GPU
   * at some point OpenGL ES 3.0 support will be added as well (cause Android), but for now the Vulkan backend is the only one

While this project intends to be as portable as it is, I do my testing primarly on x86-64 Windows. Linux will likely work out of the box, macOS may require getting Vulkan compatibility layers like MoltenVK installed.

### Raytracing support????

## Building
You need two things:
 * a Rust compiler (latest stable)
 * a C compiler usable by Rust, such as MSVC or GCC

Run `cargo build` and wait for magic to happen. The first build may spiral into quite a lot of dependencies to build, so uh, yeah

It shouldn't take that long

## License stuff
No license attached here yet; it'll likely be GPL

This project also comes with Lua 5.0.2, see `lua/COPYRIGHT` file for details.
